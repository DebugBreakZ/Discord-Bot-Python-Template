# 👋 Simple Discord Bot (Python)

A minimal **Hello World–style Discord bot** built with Python and `discord.py`.  
Perfect as a starter template for experimenting with commands, events, and automation on Discord.

## Dependencies:
- discord.py
**pip install discord.py**

## Why?
- I was annoyed at having to write the same code over and over =)
